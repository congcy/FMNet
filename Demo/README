General description:
      We have provided several files as follows:
      The FMNet model architecture --> train.py
      The FMNet well-trained model --> fmnet.cnn
      The FMNet prediction code    --> predict.py
      A small test dataset         --> test_data

      Additionally, we also provide:
      Our test output results      --> test_out_ours
      Kagan angle calculation code --> Plot_Kagan_angle

1, System requirements:
   It is trained and tested on Linux system,
      Linux version 4.4.0-31-generic (buildd@lgw01-16) 
       (gcc version 5.3.1 20160413 (Ubuntu 5.3.1-14ubuntu2.1) )
      
   Python is required. The version we used: Python 3.5.2

2, No need to installation

3, We have provided a demo of testing dataset,
   To run the prediction demo, type in "python predict.py"
   Expected output are predicted probability stored under "test_output"
   Output files are saved in matlab format, each file represents one test sample
   We have provided our predicted outputs under "test_output_ours" for your comparison

4, To plot the Kagan angle histogram using Matlab, go to folder "Plot_Kagan_angle"
   (1) Plot_kagan.m is for plotting the Kagan angle distribution histogram
   (2) Plot_predicted_probability.m is for plotting the predicted probability.
   (3) sub_kang.m is a subroutine from Matlab open source library for calculating Kagan angle
   (4) sub_conpa.m is a subroutine for converting the output to strike,dip,and rake
 
   You can set the data path to our results '../test_output_ours/predict_%06d.mat' to compare.
